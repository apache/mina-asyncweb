/**
 * A very simple resolver which simply uses the full URI after
 * stripping an optional prefix as the name of the service.
 * <p>
 * <code>SimplePrefixResolver</code> is useful when a very
 * naming scheme is used - and allows services to be resolved
 * "dynamically" without any global configuration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Request URIs which do not begin with the configured prefix are
 * not resolved.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose all <code>HttpService</code>s are addressed
 * under the prefix <code>/services/</code>. We would then map as
 * follows for the following URIs:
 * </p>
 * <table border="1" cellpadding="2">
 *  <caption>Example Mappings</caption>
 *  <tr><td>URI</td><td>Service Name</td></tr>
 *  <tr><td>/services/serviceA</td><td>serviceA</td></tr>
 *  <tr><td>/services/serviceB</td><td>serviceB</td></tr>
 *  <tr><td>/services/x/serviceX</td><td>x/serviceA</td></tr>
 *  <tr><td>/x/serviceA</td><td>null</td></tr>
